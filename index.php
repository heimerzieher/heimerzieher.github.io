        <p>I am a PhD at student at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca">Western University</a> interested in (higher) category theory, logic and type theory and homotopical algebra. My supervisors are Chris Kapulkin (Department of Mathematics) and John Bell (Department of Philosophy). I obtained a MSc in Mathematics from Western and an MA in Philosophy from <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/philosophy">Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland</a>.</p>
    
        <p>Currently, I am working on the interpretation and semantics of homotopy type theory (HoTT) in infinity-categories. Part of my research is developing a semantic framework for HoTT in elementary infinity toposes.</p>
